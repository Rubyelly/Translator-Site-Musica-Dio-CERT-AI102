To access it, you can sign up for an\\nAWS Builder ID , which does not require an AWS account. This allows you to explore the features of Amazon Q Developer CLI, including natural language command execution and code transformation, within certain usage limits.\\nThe functionality being used in this blog lies within the free tier and will not incur any costs if you choose to follow along or develop a game inspired by this blog.\\nAmazon Q CLI installation\\nInstall Amazon Q CLI\\nThe steps for installing Amazon Q CLI are available in the\\nofficial AWS documentation\\nAuthenticate Amazon Q CLI by running the command:\\nq login . This opens a browser window for authentication. Log in with your AWS Builder ID to access the free-tier.\\nYou can run your prompts directly on the Q CLI, or as I am doing in this blog - via the VSCode extension.\\nInstall VS Code Extension\\n(Optional)\\na) Open Visual Studio Code.\\nb) Go to Extensions\\n(Ctrl+Shift+X) .\\nc) Search for\\nAmazon Q .\\nd) Click\\nInstall\\non the official Amazon Q extension.\\n4) Configure Amazon Q in VS Code\\n(Optional)\\na) Open the Command Palette\\n(Ctrl+Shift+P) .\\nb) Type and select\\n“Amazon Q: Connect” .\\nc) Follow prompts to authenticate using your AWS Builder ID (same as CLI).\\n5) Test Setup\\na) Run\\nq help\\nin a VS Code terminal or on the Q CLI (if you are not using the VSCode IDE)\\nb) Use commands like q ask or q code to verify integration.\\nImplementation - Prompt and Amazon Q CLI output\\nClick the\\nAmazon Q CLI\\nextension icon in your VSCode to start the implementation!\\nLet\\'s enter our first prompt!\\nGame - Version 1\\nAmazon Q CLI not only wrote a Python script for the\\nRock, Paper, Scissors\\ngame, but also generated well documented instructions in\\nREADME.md\\ndescribing the functionality and execution instructions!\\nLet us test what we created!\\nWhile this version of the implementation aligns well with the input prompt, works well and is without any (visible) bugs, let\\'s see if we can UP our game!\\nUpdated prompt and Amazon Q output\\nPrompt 2\\nupdate the code to take the player\\'s name as input for a more personalized feel. Update the quality of the game graphics and change the color scheme to something more subtle that works well in both light and dark themed devices\\nGame - Version 2\\nNow that looks much better! While there is a slight rendering issue, the look and feel of the game has improved to a great extent. You may continue interacting with Amazon Q CLI to tweak the game as per your liking.\\nI noticed that Amazon Q did not update the\\nREADME.md\\nand\\ngame_specs.txt\\nfiles this time around. Probably my prompt was the culprit here, since I only asked it to \"update the code\". Another reminder for us that\\nAI assistants are only as good as the prompt !\\nPrompt 3\\nupdate all the files to reflect the latest changes in main.py\\nBonus\\nI asked Amazon Q to create a flowchart of the application and it generated the flowchart in three formats!\\nA\\n.txt\\n, a markdown\\n.md\\nversion and a\\nPython script\\nto generate the flowchart diagram at runtime!\\nWhaaatttttt????\\nmind blown\\nGithub Repository\\naggarwal-tanushree\\n/\\nrock-paper-scissors-python\\nRock, Paper, Scissors Game\\nA modern 2D implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with Python and Pygame, featuring personalized gameplay and enhanced visuals.\\nGame Rules\\nRock beats scissors\\nScissors beat paper\\nPaper beats rock\\nFeatures\\nPersonalized gameplay with player name input\\nModern UI with subtle color scheme for both light and dark themes\\nInteractive elements with hover effects and animations\\nScore tracking across multiple rounds\\nSimple mouse and keyboard controls\\nEnd-game summary with personalized results\\nRequirements\\nPython 3.6 or higher\\nPygame 2.5.2 or higher\\nInstallation\\nClone or download this repository\\nInstall the required dependencies:\\npip install -r requirements.txt\\nHow to Play\\nRun the game:\\npython main.py\\nEnter your name when prompted\\nClick on one of the colored squares to make your choice\\nRed square: Rock\\nGreen square: Paper\\nBlue square: Scissors\\nAfter seeing the result, click\\n\"Play Again\" button to play another round\\n\"End Game\" button to…\\nView on GitHub\\nConclusion\\nAI tools like Amazon Q CLI are incredibly powerful and flexible — they let you talk to your programming language or your cloud setup almost like you\\'re having a conversation, right from the command line. You can ask it to write code, fix bugs, manage services and more, which can save tons of time and make complex tasks easier.\\nBut there\\'s a catch: if you\\'re not familiar with programming or how your systems work, it\\'s easy to make mistakes. You might accidentally change something important, open up a security hole, or rack up unexpected costs. So while these tools are super helpful, they work best when you understand what they’re doing behind the scenes and don’t just trust them blindly.\\nRemember, AI assistants are only as good as your prompt!\\nThank you for stopping by!
